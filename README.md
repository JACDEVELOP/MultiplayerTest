# MultiplayerTest

To test the this, do you need to open steam and then open the build, or run the project in standalone with steam open
with this do you can see your steam username above the character head, to test with other players be sure that
both players are in the same steam region, if doesn't are in the same region the game is not going to connect the players
to the same match, thanks for the opportunity guys :D
